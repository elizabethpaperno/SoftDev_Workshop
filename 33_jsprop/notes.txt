DISCO:
* alert() sends a notif to the webpage
* this is a keyword that returns the object that the function is accessed by
* when true is passed into all the eventListeners the alerts propegates in tree order
* when true is passed into one eventListener it appears first and the other appear in the order they are run 
* e.stopPropagation() --> stops further alerts
* e.cancleBubble = true --> does the same thing as e.stopPropagation() but is no longer used
* bubbling occurs when events are called on children and parents
